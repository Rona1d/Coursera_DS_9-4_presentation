## Introduction

* This presentation introduces an application that shows where the different countries within Europe are located
* This was done in fullfillment of the assignment of week 4 of the 'Developing Data Products' course within the Coursera specialization track 'Data Science'
* Goal of the assignment was to build a (reproducible) online application and presentation
